# cmudict
Search scripts for the cmudict.

This script is meant to make the cmudict project more accessible to poets who rely heavily on the sounds and stresses of words versus just their spelling. It allows you to search word sounds by regular expressions, allowing you to quickly find true rhymes, slant rhymes, or any particular stress patterns you may need to complete your work.

The official cmudict currently only supports North American English pronunciations, however separate unofficial GitHub projects could be started for multi-national and multi-lingual support, as well.

You can download this repo from the below link to get started:  
https://github.com/ScriptTiger/cmudict/archive/master.zip

This repo is only the search script and you must combine the contents of this repo with the cmudict for it to work properly:
